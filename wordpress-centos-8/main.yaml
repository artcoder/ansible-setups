# To install WordPress on a low-RAM CentOS 8 cloud server using Ansible 2.7
#
# This assumes SSH key login, 
# so set up SSH login to the remote server before running this playbook.
# You can add this to the ~/.ssh/config file:
##
#   Host <remote host nickname>
#   Hostname <DNS or IP address>
#   user <remote username for ssh>
#   identityfile ~/.ssh/<private key file>.pem
##
#
# Reads passwords and SSL files from a vault, so make the vault with:
#   ansible-vault create secret.yml
# Add the SSL files to the vault using the same password:
#   ansible-vault encrypt site.key site.crt site.ca-bundle
#
# It needs aide-email.cron, make-backups.cron, and reboot-for-updates.cron
#   in the same folder as this playbook.

# Run this with something like:
#   ansible-playbook main.yaml --ask-vault-pass
